/**
 * A fragment is the smallest unit of a change. A fragment is generally checked as a whole by a reviewer,
 * and separately from other fragments. Examples for fragments are methods that are new or changed considerably,
 * but also single lines or even parts of expressions, if there was only a small change in that area of the code.
 * A fragment denotes a continuous portion of a file in a specific revision. If the change for this fragment was
 * a pure deletion, so that there is no code to point to left in that revision of the file, this is denoted
 * specially.
